# Paved Road No Level

A quality of life mod that removes the leveling effect from the "Paved Road" of the Hoe. Now you can pave your roads without messing with the terrain!

## Configuration
The mod comes with a config, be sure to check wether the config has changed in future updates. The following options are available:
 - **Enable**: Enable this mod. Default: *true*
 - **Stonecutter requirement**: Enable the Stonecutter as a requirement (to pave roads). Default: *true*

## Roadmap
There are still some features planned to be implemented:
 - ServerSync (Not sure if it already works, untested)
